CURRENT ISSUES
==============

1. Cannot log into the mobile site, even with gmail and register through a
phone.
	TODO: try to change the agent.

2. The credit card is deemed as invalid when try to makde a reservation.
However, the accounts are still alive, so we can still query surge pricing.

Current Findings
================
1. Each Uber user (including drivers and clients) has a unique classifier,
uuid.
2. Each Uber car type has a vehicleView, which provides information for the
current surge pricing.
3. In nearbyVehicles, Uber provides a list of cars of certain type nearby
the current location, with eta and a path vector(?). If there is no
certain car nearby, a sorryMsg will be provided.
4. A PingClient POST message is sent by the app on a ~ 5 sec interval.
5. Surge prcing is independently applied to different types of cars. For
example, I observed an instance that there is a price surge in UberX but
not in uberXL and uberSUV, because of the minfare and perDistanceUnit are
different(?). Uber blacks are more expensive than other types of cars.
6. Different types of cars cover different areas. For example, I set the
pickup location in a rural area, where no uberX and uberTaxi are available,
but uber black cars were willing to pick me up in 20 mins.
7. Uber provides some APIs. One of our interest is price estimate API, which
provides a property surge_multiplier to show the current price surge.
However, no car info are available. A dev ID is required to call the API
and the rate-limit is 1000 per hour per dev ID.
8. Uber uses google maps, mobileapptracking.com, crashlytics.com...
9. SessionLength message is posted when the iphone goes back to sleep. A
sessionlength value (in seconds) must be provided.
10. Change sessionhash for every session.
